<p><strong>Developer note:</strong> this is essentially copy-pasted (minus this paragraph, natch) into the documentation pages on the G3 project page. Feel free to add/adjust the documentation as needed. The class <span class="bg2fp_beta">bg2fp_beta (red)</span> should be used to mark fixes that are in the Beta Core Fixes (nothing yet) and the <span class="bg2fp_modder">bg2fp_modder (magenta)</span> class should be used for modder notes. In the live pages, these are normally colored, but hidden, unless the user enables them. </p>

  <li>Cause Disease is an abjuration spell, not necromancy. <span class="bg2fp_modder">(strref #21478)</span></li>
  <li>The description for Carrion Summons indicated that it would summon &quot;1d2&quot; carrion crawlers, but it's not a 50-50 chance. The spell has a 65% chance to summon two, and as such the language has been generalized. <span class="bg2fp_modder">(strref #35784)</span></li>
  <li>The Sun Soulbeam ability did not roll for an attack, it just hits, contrary to its description.<span class="bg2fp_modder"> (strrefs #36015, #37263)</span></li>
  <li>Several of the  shapeshifting abilities and spells did not list all of their abilities; generally it was the weapon enchantment of their natural weapons. <span class="bg2fp_modder">(strrefs #36172, #36173, #36174, #36176, #36178, #36180, #36182, #36184, #36186, #36597, #40308, #40309, #40310, #40311, #40312, #40313, #40314, #40315, #40939, #40940, #40941)</span></li>
  <li>The ranger Charm Animal ability does not mention its duration. <span class="bg2fp_modder">(strref #40299)</span></li>
  <li>Tenser's Transformation does not mention that it also provides a +2 to-hit bonus above and beyond the fighter THAC0 <span class="bg2fp_modder">(strref #7808)</span></li>
  <li>Clarified several skill progressions in the descriptions for monks and archers <span class="bg2fp_modder">(strrefs #37111, #37256)</span></li>
  <li>The breath attack of Dragon Disciples scales with level, but the ability description omitted this information <span class="bg2fp_modder">(strref #36315)</span></li>
  <li>Some bows and crossbows didn't specify the damage type if they provided bonus damage <span class="bg2fp_modder">(strrefs #3323, #6858, #7350, #8712, #8911, #16288, #17668, #24309, #25818, #27364, #40639)</span></li>
  <li>Remove Magic always dispels magic in IWDEE, but the description mistakenly stated that it was using the dice roll/level comparison dispel mechanic from BGEE/BG2EE <span class="bg2fp_modder">(strref #35872)</span></li>
  <li>Magical Stone's description indicated that it was subject to weapon restrictions (e.g. struck as a +1 weapon) but this is not true&mdash;it's a normal spell doing normal spell damage like Magic Missile <span class="bg2fp_modder">(strref #12317)</span></li>
  <li>Glyph of Warding does not go away if the player changes area, but the description said otherwise <span class="bg2fp_modder">(strref #12200)</span></li>
  <li>Crieck's name was not consistent <span class="bg2fp_modder">(strref #27380)</span></li>
  <li>Ol' Withery states that the target takes 2d8 damage if they make their save against Finger of Death, but it actually does 2d8+1 on a failed save <span class="bg2fp_modder">(strref #2864)</span></li>
  <li>The listed radius of Soul Eater was incorrect in its body description <span class="bg2fp_modder">(strref #21461)</span></li>
  <li>Fixed a Chinese-language-specific UI bug <span class="bg2fp_modder">(strrefs #11293, #16480, #19719, #19720)</span></li>

  <li>When starting a new HoW game, new characters were given default equipment based on their class. Due to errors in the table, some classes and kits (notably shamans) received nothing at all. <span class="bg2fp_modder">(25stweap.2da)</span></li>
  <li>Blast Skeletons are supposed to explode into snowballs when hit, but the explosion could be unreliable. <span class="bg2fp_modder">(4003blst.bcs, ar4003.are, ar9714.are, efbstskl.bcs, sklblst.itm, sklblsta.spl)</span></li>

  <li>Fireshield-type spells&mdash;Fireshields or similar effects that would retaliate or perform other actions when the target was struck&mdash;would interrupt the casting sounds and other audio of the creature they were protecting, even if the fireshield and its effects were silent. <span class="bg2fp_modder">(1tarss.spl, aurstaf.itm, balshld.spl, bdclck03.itm, bddispb2.spl, bdhamat2.itm, bdleat02.itm, bdleat07.itm, bdsalf01.itm, bdsha12a.itm, bdsha18a.itm, bdshld02.itm, bdshld08.itm, bdsw1h01.itm, bdsw1h08.itm, bdsw1h14.itm, bdtroll1.itm, bdwolfd1.itm, cdhgtrl.itm, cdtorgal.itm, cdtrlblz.itm, cireve.itm, elemchan.itm, elemcryo.itm, elemhydr.itm, elemimix.itm, elemyanc.itm, elemzaam.itm, leat23.itm, melis02.spl, npsw03.itm, ohbglov1.itm, ohdarmor.itm, ohrbelt2.itm, plysala.itm, reg1hp2.itm, salgrfir.itm, salgrice.itm, shld08p.itm, sklblst.itm, spbgbfs2.eff, spcl118.spl, spcl237d.eff, spcl941.spl, spin644.spl, sppr515d.eff, sppr603d.eff, sppr698d.eff, sppr725.spl, sppr725d.eff, sppr730d.eff, spwi403d.eff, spwi418d.eff, spwi818a.eff, spwi918a.eff, spwm101d.eff, sw1p01.itm, sw2hd1.itm, trollreg.itm)</span></li>

  <li>Some items and spells that cause elemental damage would prevent their own effects if the target was immune, e.g. the Dagger of Venom wouldn't even apply its poison if the target had 100% (or greater) poison resistance.

<ul>
  <li>The doors in the Eldathyn area on the fourth floor of Dragon's Eye are supposed to open once the truth is discovered. However, due to bad variable scope, the scripts would loop and continue to open the doors if they were closed later.<span class="bg2fp_modder"> (ar4004.bcs, d4doorg.bcs, d4doort.bcs, d4geldor.bcs)</span></li>
  <li>Similar to the above, doors in Yxunomei's area on the next floor of Dragon's Eye had the same issue once they were forced open. <span class="bg2fp_modder">(ar4005.bcs, d5door.bcs)</span></li>
  <li>One of the doors in the Severed Hand should open five seconds after the party entered, but was opening instantly. <span class="bg2fp_modder">(5104d3.bcs)</span></li>
  <li>Petrification traps in Malavon's lair should only fire once each, but could fire indefinitely due to a bad variable scope. <span class="bg2fp_modder">(ldeyetp1.bcs, ldeyetp2.bcs)</span></li>
  <li>The message about the broken bridge at the aquarium exterior was only supposed to fire once per area visit, but would fire every time the bridge was approached. <span class="bg2fp_modder">(wtbridge.bcs)</span></li>
  <li>Three other door/container scripts would infinitely loop due to bad variable scope. While overall harmless, they're fixed anyway. <span class="bg2fp_modder">(eetpldor.bcs, ldbdgopn.bcs, udtrap1.bcs)</span></li>
  <li>When the fight against Yxunomei begins, the doors close to seal off the party in a smaller area. If the party gets split on either side of the door, the game can soft-lock if Yxunomei kills the party members on its side: the remainder can't open the door, but also can't recover their dead party members. The closed doors will now open on Yxunomei's death or after one turn, whichever happens first. <span class="bg2fp_modder">(d5yxudor.bcs)</span></li>
  <li>Two doors would detect as being trapped even though they weren't. <span class="bg2fp_modder">(ar7000.are, ar7002.are)</span></li>
  <li>The original IWD had a repeated random treasure in HoW, of which one was replaced by an unused random drop. After going back and looking at the original, the wrong duplicate was replaced. <span class="bg2fp_modder">(ar9200.are, ar9601.are)</span></li>
  <li>In the tower with the Harpy Matriarch, several harpies are supposed to despawn on easier difficulties to make it an easier fight. However, the scripting was mistargeted and the harpies remained. <span class="bg2fp_modder">(ar9706.are)</span></li>
  <li>Floor or container traps could potentially crash the game if the trap effects were channeled through an unnamed spell and blocked by a target who is immune.<span class="bg2fp_modder"> (spwi018.spl, spwi019.spl, spwi028.spl, spwi029.spl)</span></li>
  <li>The aquarium exterior did not have an entry for the tracking skill, as it had been assigned as a duplicate to the frost giant cave <span class="bg2fp_modder">(tracking.2da)</span></li>
  <li>The shriekers in the garden of Marketh's palace are supposed to summon creatures from nearby areas to fight, but were missing the scripting to do so <span class="bg2fp_modder">(ar8005.bcs, ar8005.ini)</span></li>
  <li>If the 'Show Triggers On Tab' option was enabled in the game's baldur.lua, it would show visible triggers over area triggers which are supposed to be invisible, e.g. a region used to prompt dialogue or a quest event <span class="bg2fp_modder">(ar1105.are, ar3101.are, ar3201.are, ar3301.are, ar3501.are, ar3502.are, ar3503.are, ar3601.are, ar3602.are, ar4003.are, ar4005.are, ar6005.are, ar6006.are, ar6011.are, ar7005.are, ar8003.are, ar8009.are, ar9502.are, ar9600.are, ar9603.are, ar9708.are, ar9714.are, ar9718.are, ar9800.are, ar9801.are)</span></li>

  <li>Only four of the five random lines from the generic slave dialogue in the frost giant caves could fire. <span class="bg2fp_modder">(dgntslav.dlg)</span></li>
  <li>One of the rumors available in the Kuldahar pub was a dialogue line from Arundel, and is removed. <span class="bg2fp_modder">(dkurum.dlg)</span></li>

  <li>Two generic replies from the captive villagers in Dragon's Eye were being blocked due to bad weighting. <span class="bg2fp_modder">(dcapvil.dlg)</span></li>
  <li>Contact Other Plane had multiple issues. Questions about Larrel were being blocked by the wrong area check, as were questions about Jamoth's tomb. Asking about Pomab in the last chapter should at least wait until you're back in Easthaven

  <li>You should be able to ask Edion about Hjollder when you reach Burial Isle, but he was checking for the wrong variable values. <span class="bg2fp_modder">(dedion.dlg)</span></li>

<p>There were several ways that polymorphing&mdash;whether via a spell like Shapechange, a druid's natural abilities, or from an item like Cloak of the Wolf&mdash;could introduce numerous issues, especially when shifting directly between forms. A creature could retain stats or abilities from a previous form, or forced/voluntary/timed shapheshifts could overrun one another. As such, these abilities went through a complete overhaul designed to streamline the process, cover edge cases, and minimize issues. <span class="bg2fp_modder">(brblp.itm, brbrp.itm, cdgoliro.itm, cdmindfl.itm, cdpolybb.itm, cdpolypb.itm, cdpolyww.itm, cdshwele.itm, druear.itm, drufir.itm, earthrn.itm, eelem.itm, felem.itm, firern.itm, gvalor1.itm, plybear1.itm, plybear2.itm, plybeetl.itm, plyflind.itm, plyjelly.itm, plymstar.itm, plypbear.itm, plysala.itm, plyspid.itm, plyspid2.itm, plywolf1.itm, plywwolf.itm, plywyvrn.itm, shtroll.cre, spcl101.spl, spcl107.spl, spcl108.spl, spcl110.spl, spcl112.spl, spcl113.spl, spcl114.spl, spcl611.spl, spcl612.spl, spcl613.spl, spcl632.spl, spcl633.spl, spcl634.spl, spcl643.spl, spcl644.spl, spcl731.spl, spdm103.spl, spin122.spl, spin123.spl, spin124.spl, spin150.spl, spin150r.eff, spin151.spl, spin152.spl, spin153.spl, spin154.spl, spin155.spl, spin156.spl, spin157.spl, spin160.spl, spin197.spl, spin198.spl, spin974.spl, spinhum.spl, spinhume.eff, spinhume.spl, spinhumr.spl, spinhumw.eff, spinhumw.spl, splprot.2da, splstate.ids, sppr110.spl, sppr206.spl, sppr213.spl, sppr219.spl, sppr322.spl, sppr425.spl, sppr721.spl, sppr731.spl, sppr731a.spl, sppr732.spl, sppr732a.spl, spwi117.spl, spwi216.spl, spwi218.spl, spwi325.spl, spwi415.spl, spwi416.spl, spwi480.spl, spwi481.spl, spwi482.spl, spwi489.spl, spwi489r.eff, spwi490.spl, spwi491.spl, spwi493.spl, spwi494.spl, spwi495.spl, spwi496.spl, spwi497.spl, spwi498.spl, spwi499.spl, spwi518.spl, spwi626.spl, spwi630.spl, spwi711.spl, spwi711a.spl, spwi716.spl, spwi814.spl, spwi915.spl, spwi916.spl, spwi920.spl, spwm113.spl, spwm113a.spl, spwm183.spl, squirp.itm, trollall.itm, welem.itm, werewlf1.itm, werewlf2.itm, wolfchar.cre, wolfgr.itm, wolfm.itm, wswolf.itm)</span></p>

<p>The easy fixes: Eye of the Sword  shouldn't absorb stunning damage, which is primarily used by Enrage's HP backlash, nor should the Eye of the Mage absorb magic damage. The substantially more  extensive and esoteric fix is that Eyes that respond to specific effects&mdash;such as the Eye of Venom being triggered by poison&mdash;are heavily reliant on internal ordering of other spells and items. If the poison effect isn't the first effect of the spell/item being applied, the mage could receive a poison portrait icon, some visuals, and only when the game tried to apply the actual poison would the Eye of Venom respond. In other words, the mage could avoid the actual poison and yet suffer some cosmetic effects or have the poison count against other protections. <span class="bg2fp_modder">(</span><span class="bg2fp_modder">#beltyn.spl, #deathf1.spl, #deathf2.spl, #deathf3.spl, #sunrund.spl, 7eyes.2da, axemino.itm, axemino.spl, basill1.itm, basill1.spl, bdsha06a.spl, bdsumst1.spl, bdsumst4.spl, carrio1.itm, carrio1.spl, cdsunrun.spl, cwreve.itm, cwreve.spl, dart03.itm, dart03.spl, dazer.itm, dazer.spl, deva.itm, deva.spl, ghast1.itm, ghast1p.spl, ghoul1.itm, ghoul1.spl, ghoult.itm, ghoult.spl, icegolem.itm, icegolem.spl, icetrl.itm, icetrlst.spl, insanitc.spl, insanitf.spl, insanity.spl, kris.itm, kris.spl, ltouch.spl, mae.itm, mae.spl, plybass.itm, plybass.spl, poison.itm, poison.spl, poq2-16.itm, poq2-16.spl, potn23.itm, potn23.spl, ring03.itm, ring03.spl, sareveff.spl, sflail.itm, sflail1.spl, sflail2.spl, sflail3.spl, sflail4.spl, spbatt1.itm, spbatt1.spl, spbatt2.itm, spbatt2.spl, spbatt3.itm, spbatt3.spl, spbatt4.itm, spbatt4.spl, spbatt5.itm, spbatt5.spl, spcl103.spl, spcl118.spl, spcl123.spl, spcl236.spl, spcl239a.spl, spcl239b.spl, spcl411.spl, spcl411a.spl, spcl411b.spl, spcl411c.spl, spcl411f.spl, spcl415.spl, spcl415h.spl, spcl751a.spl, spcl751b.spl, spcl908.spl, spcl911b.spl, spdr101.spl, spin115.spl, spin132.spl, spin132a.spl, spin132b.spl, spin139.spl, spin139a.spl, spin139b.spl, spin191.spl, spin191a.spl, spin733.spl, spin973.spl, spogre01.spl, sppr115.spl, sppr218.spl, sppr250.spl, sppr325.spl, sppr325a.spl, sppr419.spl, sppr419a.spl, sppr422.spl, sppr426.spl, sppr426a.spl, sppr517.spl, sppr517a.spl, sppr517b.spl, sppr519.spl, sppr522.spl, sppr609.spl, sppr609a.spl, sppr609d.spl, sppr614b.spl, sppr614c.spl, sppr614d.spl, sppr614e.spl, sppr617.spl, sppr617a.spl, sppr617b.spl, sppr716.spl, sppr720.spl, sppr722.spl, sppr722a.spl, sppr728.spl, sppr728a.spl, spwatt2.itm, spwatt2.spl, spwatt3.itm, spwatt3.spl, spwatt4.itm, spwatt4.spl, spwatt5.itm, spwatt5.spl, spwi006.spl, spwi006a.spl, spwi007.spl, spwi007a.spl, spwi008.spl, spwi008a.spl, spwi009.spl, spwi009a.spl, spwi010.spl, spwi011.spl, spwi011a.spl, spwi012.spl, spwi012a.spl, spwi018.spl, spwi018a.spl, spwi019.spl, spwi019a.spl, spwi028.spl, spwi028a.spl, spwi028b.spl, spwi029.spl, spwi029a.spl, spwi029b.spl, spwi030a.spl, spwi030b.spl, spwi030c.spl, spwi118.spl, spwi125.spl, spwi223.spl, spwi224.spl, spwi224a.spl, spwi303.spl, spwi303a.spl, spwi303b.spl, spwi303c.spl, spwi303d.spl, spwi303e.spl, spwi303f.spl, spwi327.spl, spwi327a.spl, spwi411.spl, spwi422a.spl, spwi431.spl, spwi509.spl, spwi612.spl, spwi626a.spl, spwi714.spl, spwi714a.spl, spwi714b.spl, spwi714c.spl, spwi922.spl, spwi925.spl, spwish27.spl, spwish35.spl, spyanc01.spl, trnbolt.itm, trnbolt.spl, u1ham3b.itm, u1ham3b.spl, u1hax2a.itm, u1hax2a.spl, u1hax4b.itm, u1hax4b.spl, u2hax5a.itm, u2hax5a.spl, uarow3a.itm, uarow3a.spl, uarow3b.itm, uarow3b.spl, ubswd5b.itm, ubswd5b.spl, udart1a.itm, udart1a.spl, udart2a.itm, udart2a.spl, udart3b.itm, udart3b.spl, uflal2b.itm, uflal2b.spl, uflal5a.itm, uflal5a.spl, uhalb4a.itm, uhalb4a.spl, uhalb4b.itm, uhalb4b.spl, ulswd3b.itm, ulswd3b.spl, ulswd4a.itm, ulswd4a.spl, ulswd5b.itm, ulswd5b.spl, umstr2a.itm, umstr2a.spl, umstr2b.itm, umstr2b.spl, umstr3a.itm, umstr3a.spl, umstr5a.itm, umstr5a.spl, usswd5b.itm, usswd5b.spl, utswd2b.itm, utswd2b.spl, utswd3a.itm, utswd3a.spl, utswd5a.itm, utswd5a.spl, wand02.itm, wand02.spl, wand04.itm, wand04.spl, wand19.itm, wand19a.spl, wand19b.spl, wand19c.spl, xclub.itm, xclub.spl, young.itm, young.spl, zze6pe.itm, zze6pe.spl, zzj6sp.itm, zzj6sp.spl, zzm5mh.itm, zzm5mh.spl)</span></p>

<p>In the original Baldur's Gate, there were four internal methods to make an NPC freeze: paralysis (used in undead melee attacks), web (used by the spell of the same name and spiders), and two forms of hold (one for Hold spells and a second, special one reserved for special cases like cutscenes). As the series progressed through the BG expansion, into BG2, and concluding with Throne of Bhaal, these were used more and more freely, and muddled&mdash;you had web spells using paralysis, abilities that blocked the special hold (which nothing should) to the point where there was little distinction, if any, between these effects from a player's point of view. EEFP is re-establishing the scheme, going all the way back to the original Baldur's Gate, of trying to use these effects in a way that 
  differentiates them and fixes a number of bugs along the way. Paralysis is, once again, the domain of undead attacks, and from which elves have some protection. Web is no longer paired by default with paralysis, meaning items which protect you from web no longer provide paralysis protection by accident, and the special hold will now always take effect. <span class="bg2fp_modder">(antiweb.itm, enginest.2da, ipsion.itm, minhp1.itm, ohsmode1.spl, ohsmode4.spl, ring97.itm, spcl152.spl, spcl233b.spl, spcl242.spl, spcl321.spl, spcl742.spl, spdr201.spl, spin117.spl, sppr208.spl, sppr305.spl, sppr508.spl, sppr728.spl, sppr989.spl, spwi215.spl, spwi306.spl, spwi324.spl, spwi507.spl, spwi818.spl, spwi818a.spl, spwi918.spl, spwi918a.spl, spwm122.spl, trollimm.itm)</span></p>

<p>In the original Baldur's Gate II engine, something that made you 'immune to X' was actually fairly limited: you could make the character directly immune to the effect and (typically) the normal portrait icon, but many of the ancillary effects (sound effects, visuals, etc.) were hit or miss. A party member under free action would resist being paralyzed by a ghast, but the sound effect that plays when the paralysis was supposed to expire would still play. Similarly, creatures immune to confusion would resist the confusion itself but still play a spinning animation over their head for the spell's intended duration. Thankfully, the EEs provide more tools for dealing with immunities, and we can  block all of these subsidiary effects. A parallel issue occurred when removing or curing effects. If you used Remove Fear on a panicking creature, the spinning animation over their head didn't always go away or the expiration sound would still play. Using a new EE feature, these subsidiary effects can be removed when the main effect is removed. <span class="bg2fp_modder">(#cureber.spl, #curebld.spl, #curecon.spl, #curedef.spl, #curedis.spl, #curedrk.spl, #curefbm.spl, #curefer.spl, #curehol.spl, #cureinv.spl, #cureldr.spl, #curendt.spl, #curepse.spl, #curepsn.spl, #curesil.spl, #cureslp.spl, #curestn.spl, #palfear.spl, adisease.itm, arow07.itm, bdconstr.itm, bdsleep.itm, behamu.itm, bpdispel.spl, brdflute.itm, cdiwdtr1.spl, cdiwdtr2.spl, cdpr417.spl, cibossb.itm, ciigen.itm, deva.itm, devaheal.spl, dw#brkin.spl, dwfpgs01.spl, dwfpgs02.spl, dwfpgs03.spl, elemchan.itm, elemsunn.itm, elemzaam.itm, fjbarda.spl, fjbardb.spl, fjbladeb.spl, fkiller.itm, ghast1.itm, ghast1n.spl, giving.itm, golcla.itm, golstone.itm, helmded.itm, icetrl.itm, icetrlst.spl, insanitc.spl, insanitf.spl, insanity.spl, invulner.itm, ipsion.itm, irongol.itm, jellmu1.itm, labelt.itm, ltouch.itm, mdk2gun.itm, mdk2ring.itm, minhp1.itm, ohsmode1.spl, ohsmode4.spl, ohtyr1.spl, philter.itm, planetar.itm, pnull.itm, potn17.itm, potn20.itm, potn21.itm, potn23.itm, potn33.itm, potn45.itm, ring09.itm, ring90.itm, ring91.itm, ring95.itm, ringdemn.itm, sceptre.itm, scrl07.itm, scrl08.itm, sflail.itm, sflailst.spl, spcl104.spl, spcl111.spl, spcl115.spl, spcl152.spl, spcl221.spl, spcl222.spl, spcl231.spl, spcl232.spl, spcl232d.spl, spcl321.spl, spcl415.spl, spcl415h.spl, spcl542a.spl, spcl732.spl, spcl920a.spl, spcl921a.spl, spdr101.spl, spin115.spl, spin119.spl, spin120.spl, spin137.spl, spin161.spl, spin183.spl, spin200.spl, spin201.spl, spin734.spl, spin746.spl, spin747.spl, spin921.spl, spin923.spl, sppr103.spl, sppr108.spl, sppr212.spl, sppr217.spl, sppr303.spl, sppr308.spl, sppr309.spl, sppr315.spl, sppr317.spl, sppr321.spl, sppr350.spl, sppr401.spl, sppr403.spl, sppr404.spl, sppr417.spl, sppr422.spl, sppr502.spl, sppr505.spl, sppr505d.spl, sppr514.spl, sppr607.spl, sppr713.spl, sppr716.spl, sppr733.spl, sppr736.spl, sppr950.spl, sprngb01.itm, sprngb02.itm, sprngb03.itm, sprngb04.itm, sprngl02.itm, sprngl03.itm, sprngl04.itm, sprngs01.itm, sprngs02.itm, sprngs03.itm, sprngs04.itm, sprngz05.itm, spwi010.spl, spwi028.spl, spwi028h.spl, spwi029.spl, spwi029c.spl, spwi118.spl, spwi118a.spl, spwi118d.spl, spwi118e.spl, spwi118f.spl, spwi203.spl, spwi210.spl, spwi219.spl, spwi224.spl, spwi302.spl, spwi323.spl, spwi326.spl, spwi411.spl, spwi427.spl, spwi515.spl, spwi609.spl, spwi609d.spl, spwi802.spl, spwi806.spl, spwish07.spl, spwish28.spl, spwish39.spl, spwish46.spl, spwm168.spl, stalker.itm, stupid.itm, sword01.cre, trollde.itm, trollimm.itm, uarow3b.spl, vampreg.itm, vampreg1.itm, virgin.itm)</span></p>
